# vaultoperator Provider

This Provider gives access to the `vault operator` operations, although currently only `vault operator init` is implemented.

**NOTE! This will put the root token and unseal/recovery keys into your state so use with caution!**


## Example Usage

```terraform
provider "vaultoperator" {
  # example configuration here
  vault_url = "http://vault:8200"
}
```
